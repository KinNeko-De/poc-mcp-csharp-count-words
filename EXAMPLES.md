# Example: Testing the Character Counter

This example demonstrates how the MCP server correctly counts characters, specifically addressing the "AI can't count r's in strawberry" meme.

## Quick Test

1. Build and run the server:
   ```bash
   dotnet build CharacterCounterMcp.csproj
   dotnet run --project CharacterCounterMcp.csproj
   ```

2. In another terminal, test with our prepared messages:
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project CharacterCounterMcp.csproj < test_messages.json
   ```

## Expected Results

### Test 1: "strawberry" r-counting
**Input**: `count_characters` with text="strawberry", character="r"
**Expected Output**: 
```json
{
  "text": "strawberry",
  "character": "r", 
  "count": 3,
  "analysis": "Found 3 occurrence(s) of 'r' in \"strawberry\""
}
```

**Analysis**: The word "strawberry" contains exactly 3 'r' characters:
- Position 2: "st**r**awberry"
- Position 5: "stra**r**berry" 
- Position 6: "straw**r**erry"

### Test 2: Case sensitivity demonstration
**Input**: `count_characters` with text="Programming", character="r"
**Expected Output**: 
```json
{
  "text": "Programming", 
  "character": "r",
  "count": 2,
  "analysis": "Found 2 occurrence(s) of 'r' in \"Programming\""
}
```

### Test 3: Case-insensitive counting
**Input**: `count_characters_ignore_case` with text="Programming", character="r"
**Expected Output**:
```json
{
  "text": "Programming",
  "character": "r", 
  "count": 2,
  "caseSensitive": false,
  "analysis": "Found 2 occurrence(s) of 'r' in \"Programming\" (case-insensitive)"
}
```

### Test 4: Character statistics
**Input**: `get_character_stats` with text="hello world"
**Expected Output**:
```json
{
  "text": "hello world",
  "totalCharacters": 11,
  "uniqueCharacters": 8,
  "characterBreakdown": [
    {"character": "l", "count": 3},
    {"character": "o", "count": 2},
    {"character": " ", "count": 1},
    {"character": "d", "count": 1},
    {"character": "e", "count": 1}, 
    {"character": "h", "count": 1},
    {"character": "r", "count": 1},
    {"character": "w", "count": 1}
  ],
  "mostFrequent": {"character": "l", "count": 3},
  "analysis": "Text contains 11 total characters with 8 unique characters"
}
```

## Why This Works

This MCP server demonstrates:

1. **Accurate Counting**: Shows that properly implemented systems can count characters correctly
2. **Transparency**: Provides detailed analysis of what was counted
3. **Flexibility**: Offers both case-sensitive and case-insensitive options
4. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Goes beyond simple counting to provide statistics

## Common Misconceptions Addressed

- **"AI can't count"**: This server proves that with proper implementation, character counting is straightforward
- **"It's too complex"**: The implementation is clear and well-documented
- **"Results are unreliable"**: The server provides verifiable, consistent results

## Integration with AI Systems

When integrated with an AI assistant via MCP:
1. The AI can call these tools reliably
2. Results are structured and parseable  
3. The AI can explain the counting process
4. Multiple analysis options are available

This makes the character counting capability accessible and trustworthy for AI assistants.
